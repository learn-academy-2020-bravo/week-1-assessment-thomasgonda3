# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A reusable piece of code that takes in different arguments depending on the situation.  

  Researched answer:  A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.



2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map forces every element in the array to undergo a function, then returns the new array.  Filter returns an array that removes every element in the array that does not pass a specified test.

  Researched answer: filter() returns a subset of the elements from the original array, while . map() produces an array with new, different entries based on the elements in the original array.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log outputs the evaluation of whatever argument is within itself, and does not actually change the state of the program.  When you return, you exit a function and give back an answer.

  Researched answer:  console.log logs the arguments passed to the web console, return will exit a function and also call back the value to whatever invoked the function.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: The variable input that is given when a function is run that makes it reusable.

  Researched answer:  A value that is passed between programs, subroutines or functions.  They are independent items, or variables that contain data or codes.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:  The driver types all of the code and makes quick edits if he sees a problem.  The passenger directs where the code is headed and also points out any errors in the code he sees.

  Researched answer:  Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer:  It's when you write tests for your code so that you know it works within several different scenarios.

  Researched answer:  The work flow is write the test, fail the test, write codes, test passes, then refactor your code.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:  I thought the pair programming was really fun, I didn't know how it would feel before doing it but I really enjoyed myself when going through.  I feel like when we were going through lectures and I wanted to interject sometimes everyone would just talk so quickly I didn't really have a chance but when I posted in the chat my question was usually answered so that was pretty useful.
